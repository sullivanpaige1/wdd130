    <h2>Paige Sullivan</h2>
    <p>Hi guys! My name is Paige Sullivan, or Sully, and I'm from Houston, Texas, born and raised! As much as I love the weather up here in Rexburg, I prefer the hot/humidity down south. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and watching anime!</p>
    <p>My plans after I graduate would be to teach English in either Asia or Europe, mostly in Japan and the UK. This is my seventh semester at BYU-I, but my first semester taking Software Engineering.</p>
    <p>I believe Web Fundamentals will guide me to make future decisions in my life, career wise, and I'm hoping to learn a lot from this course! I'm also excited to get to know my classmates this semester and hope to learn more about them as well.</p>
